    <h1>The exhaust</h1>
    <h3>MPS offers aesthetic and technical improvements not only for cars, but also for motorbikes. We have been
      improving vehicles for more than 15 years. For many years of successful work we have managed to gather a team of
      professional craftsmen, to equip the service with professional equipment, as well as to perform the most complex
      and unique variants of tuning.</h1>

      <p>We offer our customers the improvement of exhaust systems of auto and motorbike vehicles. Motorbike exhaust has
        its own peculiarities of tuning and is somewhat different from the car exhaust. The motorbike exhaust system
        consists of an exhaust manifold, a catalyser to eliminate exhaust gases, a muffler and a power valve. Inside,
        additional sound equipment is usually installed to reduce the noise level and make it pleasant to hear.</p>
      <p>When it comes to motorbike exhaust tuning, we offer performance improvements in three aspects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sound. A motorbike is always a sporty, deep roar that can be heard by every road user. A unique and
          beautiful "voice" can be achieved by installing specialised equipment. This can be advanced audio equipment,
          as well as sports catalysers and straight-through resonators.</li>
        <li>Power. To improve the power output of a motorbike, either the entire exhaust system or some of its
          individual components are redesigned. For modernisation, the manifold, muffler, catalytic converter and power
          boost valve of higher specification with good flow capacity are used. In total, such tuning gives up to 40%
          increase in power.</li>
        <li>Appearance. The appearance of the motorbike complements the image of its owner, so it is necessary to choose
          a unique design of the entire exhaust system. For example, the nozzle can have a different shape, colour,
          size, design and equipment. In addition, nozzles are often equipped with LED lighting. We offer styling of the
          entire exhaust when using coloured elements.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In their work, our masters use high quality materials and parts. We are an official dealer of exhaust systems
        for motorbikes of most brands, such as Gibson, Brospeed, Dynomax, Magnaflow, Ractive, Mozart and many others.
        This allows the customer to buy parts without markup.</p>
      <p>We also manufacture customised exhaust systems for motorbikes. Thanks to our co-operation with industrial
        plants, we offer quality engineered spare parts without taking into account shipping and customs clearance
        costs.</p>
