    <h1>Firmware</h1>
    <h3>We offer chip tuning and tuning of almost any motorbike equipment: motorbikes, ATVs, snowmobiles, boats, jet
      skis etc.</h1>

      <p>We perform tuning and calibration on standard engine control units. If you decide to increase the power with
        additional blocks (Power Commander, Rapid Bike), we will assist you in their adjustment and purchase. At the
        customer's request, complex injection projects are also possible, e.g. installation and tuning of Corvette
        engineering unit.</p>
      <p>When it comes to motorbike firmware tuning, we offer performance improvements in three aspects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fast technical installation. You can upgrade the firmware literally in 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Power. To improve the power output of a motorbike, either the entire exhaust system or some of its
          individual components are redesigned. For modernisation, the manifold, muffler, catalytic converter and power
          boost valve of higher specification with good flow capacity are used. In total, such tuning gives up to 40%
          increase in power.</li>
        <li>ECU firmware is available for all tastes and colours. It is possible to install aggressive - which will
          increase engine power, and accordingly quick start from the place. It is possible to put economical - great
          fuel economy, but dynamics is nil. It is possible to put factory modified (normal) - slightly increased
          dynamics, by 3 - 5 %, and the same reduced fuel consumption 3 - 5 %.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If changes are made to the iron, a bench tune-up is required. For example, replacing the silencer or installing
        a zero-impedance filter. The process is quite labour-intensive. All motorbikes are different, with different
        equipment, which requires individual adjustment on the stand.</p>
      <p>Measurements take place on our own dynamometer. It often has more capabilities than its London counterparts,
        for example, it automatically converts power from the wheel to power at the engine shaft, measuring transmission
        losses, the ability to precisely hold the load at certain revs, with good airflow, gas exhaust and a wideband
        oxygen sensor.</p>
