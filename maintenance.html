    <h1>Maintenance</h1>
    <h3>A motorbike is not only a means of transport and an alternative to a car. For some people, a motorbike becomes a
      special lifestyle, a hobby and a way to get vivid emotions. Adrenaline from a fast ride, manoeuvrability and ease
      of movement - that's what you can get by becoming a biker. In addition to the positive aspects, a motorcyclist
      also assumes additional responsibility and some obligations.</h1>

      <p>When operating a motorbike, it is necessary to keep a close eye on its condition, pay attention to any
        irregularities in its operation and inspect the most important elements before and after each journey and after
        a certain mileage.</p>
      <p>There are several stages of running-in of a motorbike. The first is up to 1000km and the second is from 1000 to
        2000km. They are necessary in order to develop all the mechanisms immediately after purchase:</p>
      <ul>
        <p>
          <li>During the first stage, driving with a passenger, driving on difficult roads and long journeys are not
            permitted. Driving should only start when the engine is well warmed up and should not exceed a speed of more
            than 60 km/h in all gears.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>In the second stage, speeds and loads are gradually increased without overloading the engine and while
            listening to its operation. It is also not recommended to drive at high revolutions for long periods of
            time.
          </li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>Before coming to a stop, throttle down and reduce speed, only then can you brake. In this way you will
            ensure the safety and durability of the engine group parts.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>Remember to check the tightness of fasteners, paying particular attention to the steering wheel, wheel,
            brake system and engine mountings.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          <li>Do not dismantle the engine while the warranty is in force, as this will invalidate the warranty.</li>
        </p>
      </ul>
      <p>For safety reasons, make a check inspection before every journey.</p>
